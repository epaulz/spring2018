- do LCS example
- Dynamic Programming
- be able to write code for all functions of a binary search tree (including all traversals)(try without recursion too)
- BSTs!!!!
- AVL Trees (rotations)


WEIGHTED INTERVAL SCHEDULING
- sort jobs by their finish times
- compute p() for each job
    - p(j) = largest index i<j such that i is compatible w/ j (finish time of i <= start time of j)
- M is a global array where M[0] = 0
- for j=1 to n, M[j] = max(weight[j-1]+M[p[j-1]],M[j-1])
- return M[n] for maximum weight
