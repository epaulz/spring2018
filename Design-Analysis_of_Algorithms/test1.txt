Greedy Algorithms
- build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece
  that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit
- locally optimal decisions
- greedy schedule contains no inversions
- all schedules without inversions have the same lateness
- analysis strategies
    - show that after each step of the greedy algorithm, its solution is at least as good as any other algorithm's
    - gradually transform any solution to the one found by the greedy algorithm without hurting its quality
    - discover a simple "structural" bound asserting that every possible solution must have a certain value.
      then, show that your algorithm always achieves this bound
- furthest-in-future is the optimal cache eviction schedule
