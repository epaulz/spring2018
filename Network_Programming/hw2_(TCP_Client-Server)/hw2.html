2: 
TCP Client/Server Program<BR>
Due Date: March. 3rd&nbsp; (by 11:59PM) </H2>
<HR>
<H3>Project Description</H3>
<P>This project is to write simple TCP client and Server in <b>C or C++. </b>
Your programs should have the following functions: </P>
<P class=indent><b>TCP Server</b></P>
<P class=indent>Your server creates a passive mode TCP socket and waits for 
client connections at a specified port. Below is an example of a command line 
that could be used to run your TCP server on port 1234:</P>
<P class=indent>./tcpserver 1234</P>
<P class=indent>When a new connection is established, the server reads ASCII 
data line by line sent by the client. The server then reverses the order of 
characters in each line and writes it to standard output. Your server should 
quit when the client finishes sending.</P>
<P class=indent><b>TCP Client</b></P>
<P class=indent>Your client connects to the TCP server at the specified port.&nbsp; 
After successfully connecting to the server, the client reads data from an ASCII 
file and sends to the TCP server. The client closes the connection after 
finishing sending the file. Below is an <font color="#FF0000">example</font> of a command line that could be 
used to run your TCP client on port 1234 and communicate with the server at 
address 130.127.45.7:</P>
<P class=indent>./tcpclient&nbsp; 130.127.45.7&nbsp; 1234&nbsp; myfile</P>
<P class=indent>The first command line parameter must be the server's IP 
address. The port number in the client program should be the same as the 
port number in the server program. &quot;myfile&quot; is the name of the ASCII file.</P>
<H3>What is required:</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>
  Your server and client must use the same port number specified in the command line. 
  </LI>
  <LI>
  Your client should read from the file specified in the third command line 
  parameter (argv[3]). </LI>
  <LI>
  Your client must send the file line by line. You can not send the file at once or character by character. </LI>
  <LI>
  Your client should close the connection after finishing sending the file.</LI>
  <LI>
  Your server must read the data line by line, and reverse the order of characters in each line and output the reversed lines to the terminal.</LI>
  <LI>
  Your server must quit when client closes the connection.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Deliverables</H3>
<P>You must submit all the source code necessary for us to build and test your 
TCP client and server. You must also include Makefile that can be used to build your 
client and server on the CS Sun workstations. If you don't know how to use make or create a Makefile, refer to the
sample TCP client and server code. Feel free to ask for help 
in creating a Makefile. </P>
<P>You must also include in your submission a file named <CODE>README</CODE> 
that includes your name and a brief description of your submission, including 
the name of each file submitted along with a one line description of what is in 
the file. If your code is not complete, tell us what works and what doesn't. If 
you are submitting code that does not compile, please tell us that as well. If 
any of your code was written by someone else, you are required to tell us about 
it (this must also be documented in the code itself). Finally, feel free to 
include a description of any problems you had or anything else you think might 
be helpful to us. </P>
<H3>Grading</H3>
<P>Your project will be tested to make sure it works properly. Here is a rough breakdown of the grading:</P>
<TABLE cellSpacing=10 border=0>
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TD>TCP Server</TD>
    <TD>40%</TD>
  <TR>
    <TD>TCP Client</TD>
    <TD>40%</TD>
  <TR>
    <TD>Submission, Error handling, Style/Code structure, etc.</TD>
    <TD>20%</TD>
  </TBODY></TABLE>
<P>NOTE: 20% of your homework grade depends on the how "well your code is 
written". These points include the following:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>
  Error handling (check every system call for an error!).</LI>
  <LI>
  Safe code (avoiding buffer overflow, etc).</LI>
  <LI>
  <P>How well we can understand your code. There is no required format for your 
	code. However, providing appropriate commends is needed to make sure that 
	other competent programmers could easily understand and make changes to your 
	code.</P></LI></UL>
<H3>Submitting your files</H3>
	<font face="Arial">All projects must be submitted via handin: </font>
	<span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: ZH-CN; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">
	<a href="https://handin.cs.clemson.edu">https://handin.cs.clemson.edu</a></span><P><font face="Arial">
Please make sure you submit all your source files not the object files.&nbsp; 
You can also zip the files using the following command first:</font><P>&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; tar&nbsp;&nbsp; 
cvzf&nbsp;&nbsp; hw2.tgz&nbsp;&nbsp; file1&nbsp; file2&nbsp;&nbsp; file3&nbsp; 
...</font><P><font face="Arial">and submit the 
single zip file hw2.tgz.&nbsp; Before you submit this single file, please use 
the following command to check make sure you have everything in this zip file:</font><P>
<font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&gt; tar&nbsp;&nbsp; tvzf&nbsp;&nbsp; hw2.tgz</font><P><B>Don't send compiled code! Please ask question if you don't understand any 
part of this project.</B></P>
